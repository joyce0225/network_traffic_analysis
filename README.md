# Network Traffic Analysis with Python, Scapy, and Machine Learning

## Overview

This project demonstrates an advanced approach to network traffic analysis using Python, Scapy, and machine learning algorithms. Inspired by the methodologies discussed in [Cylab's blog](https://cylab.be/blog/245/network-traffic-analysis-with-python-scapy-and-some-machine-learning), it is designed to efficiently process and analyze network packet data, helping in the identification of patterns, anomalies, and potential security threats in network traffic.

## Features

- **Packet Capture and Parsing**: Utilizes Scapy for deep packet inspection and parsing of `.pcap` files.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Implements robust techniques for cleaning and structuring network data.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Employs statistical methods to identify trends and anomalies in network traffic.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Leverages ML algorithms for predictive analysis and pattern recognition.
- **Visualization**: Includes graphical representations of data and analysis results for better understanding and reporting.

## Installation

To set up this project, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[YourUsername]/network-traffic-analysis.git
